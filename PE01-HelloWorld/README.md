Input
The input for this mobile app is static and predefined. It includes three pieces of information: your name, degree program (MSCS), and school (STC).

Process
The app is built using React Native and Expo, which allows for cross-platform development. It uses a single View component as the main container and three Text components to display the user's information. The StyleSheet is used to define styles, including the background color (yellow) and text formatting.

Output
The app displays the user's name, degree program, and school on a yellow background. Each piece of information is shown as a separate text element, centered on the screen. The text is styled with a bold font and a 20px font size for better readability.

The mobile app meets the user requirements by displaying the information with a yellow background and utilizes five React Native components as specified.
